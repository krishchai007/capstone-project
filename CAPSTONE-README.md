# Home Credit Capstone-Project


## Business Problem 

A significant portion of the population, particularly those with insufficient or non-existent credit histories, are more vulnerable to untrustworthy lenders who may take advantage of them. Home Credit looks to address this problem by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience for the unbanked population.

## Solution 
The goal for this project will be the reduction in loan rejections for creditworthy individuals, and the improvement in clients' loan repayment rates compared to previous methods by using the target variable of whether a client is likely to repay the loan or not. This project is aiming to identify a predictive analytical model that will identify the customers who are likely to default or not.
For this analytics project, we will use the existing dataset and associated data description to identify the appropriate predictors and come up with the best predictive analytical model.


## My Contributions
-Performed extensive EDA on the datasets
-Feature Enginered new attributes and explored its correlation with the target
-Built a LightGBM predictive model with a 72.3% accuracy 


## Business Impact 
-Main impact is that it is going to help minimize the number of borrowers who fail to repay their loans
-Minimizes fininacial damage incurred when borrowers default on their loans 
-Company can identify ways to mitigate risks 
-Help maintain a balanced portfolio by reducing risks and maximizing errors


## Challenges Faced
-As a group, we tackled extensive datasets, and each member possessed unique strengths and expertise. Initially, establishing a solid approach was challenging due to our varying levels of understanding. Nevertheless, we all demonstrated considerable initiative and a willingness to learn from our mistakes throughout the project. Ultimately, our collective efforts enabled us to successfully complete the task within an impressively short timeframe.


## Learnings 
-I learned to take initiative and enhanced my leadership skills by guiding everyone in this project
-Understood how data-driven decision making can be such a huge deal to a business
-Understanding of various predictive models in ML
